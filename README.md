The ray tracing homework for cis
##Step 1
This is the screen shots of my work. I finished the sphere intersects with the formulas, I tried to make the triangle intersects, but the formulas I've writtern didn't work and I couldn't figure out why was it. Therefore, I comment it out and coppied the halfworking version.

##Step 2 & 3
I tried to write step 2 and 3 but it seems they didn't work very well.

I apologized for not finishing the steps but I really don't know how to fix the problem.
